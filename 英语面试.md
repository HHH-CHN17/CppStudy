### introduction

Please introduce yourself

- Good morning/afternoon, everyone. It's a great pleasure for me to be here today. 

- （name, undergrad, top 5%, company，ten thousand，responsible，QFII introduce，work detail，did well）

  My name is LiPei. I majored in **computer science** when I was in un-der-grad（大学本科生） and I ranked **top 5%** among my peers（同龄人）. I am currently(now) working at Shenzhen Kingdom science and technology Company. It's a huge company with over **ten thousand** staff. I am now **responsible** for the QFII program. In this program, *qualified foreign investors would invest in the local security market through specialized accounts.* My **main responsibilities** include three 'aspects: the **development of new functions**, the **optimization of the algorithm** and **repair of the bugs**. Although I haven't been **staying here** for very long, I still succesfully finished over **40 demands**（需求） from my supervisor（主管）. 

- （strong learning abilities，keep learn(graduated)，book read, knowledge lear. compared with...，two adavantage）

  I have **strong learning abilities** and I have **kept learning** even after I graduated. In order to **develop** my professional skills, I read <**C++ primer**> and <**Understadning C++11**>. And I also got familiar with **generic, concurrent and network programming**. Compared with other possible candidates, I think my **efficient code-reading skills** and **adaptability** will make me **a better fit** for your position. 

- （具体例子，问题阐述，需求阐述，解决方案，解决结果）

  For example, there is a task named **algorithm optimization for tran-sa-c-tion交易 volume warning**. This task took **6 minutes for execution** and our clients weren't very satisfied. I needed to communicate with the clients to **clarify the needs** and try to **'op-ti-mi-ze the algorithm** to meet these needs. Finally, I decided to **replace the database** that is needed for the algorithm, and I successfully shortened the execution time to **2 minutes**.  

- I am very **passionate** about being a **software engineer** in your company and I believe I will be a **good fit**. I'm really looking forward to **our conversations** today and I'm open to **all questions**. Thank you. 

### reson of leave KD

Why do you want to leave your previous company?

- （focuses on fin-tech，not interested，technology outdated(c++ 98)，main target is... rather than...，not what I look for）

  The company I currently work for focuses on **fin-tech**. I am **not** particularly特别 **interested** in this area【那你对什么行业感兴趣？】 but more importantly, the **technology** that is being used in my company is pretty **outdated**. For example, they are still using the c++ 98 standard. I realize that our **main target** is to ensure the **sta'bility** of the system rather than applying **advanced technology**, I personally feel that this is not what I look for. 

- （great time in company: very nice，learn about the business，leader in fin-tech，but..platform->professional skills。So，recruiting information->attracted）

  Frankly, I have a **great time** in this company. My supervisors and colleagues are all **very nice** and they helped me a lot when trying to learn about the **business**. And the company is also a **leader** in fintech areas. But I am still hoping to find a **platform** where I can better use my **professional skills**. So when your company posted the **re-c-ru-iting招聘 information**, I was immediately **attracted**. 

- （first job，exploring career path。know better...my future，huge fan，young talents，join you my early stages of career。）

  This is the **first job** I found in my life and I was still exploring my **ca'reer path** when I joined the company. Now I know better about **what I want** for my future. I am a **huge fan** of your company and I know you are looking for **young talents**,  and I think it is a great chance for me to join you in **my early stages阶段 of career**. 

  That's why I want to **leave** my previous company and look for other **opportunities**. 

### reson of join NV

Why do you want to join Nvidia? What do you know about our company? 

- 科技（famous for...the most cutting-edge product...->technology-oriented company culture，wanted...join...focuses on advanced technology...，nv suitable for me）

  Your company is **famous** for the GPU development and you created **the most cutting-edge product** in this area. The **technology-oriented company culture** is very ap-'pea-ling to me. Like I mentioned before, I wanted to join a company which **focuses on advanced technology**, so I think Nvidia is more suitable for me.

- 人文（impressed by...individual care[digital AI agents for healthcare，provided language service to over 1 billion Indians through AI]->social responsbility. employees: friendly and productive environment. wondeful experience(worktime)）

  I am also deeply **impressed by** your company's attention on **individual care**. I heard that you deploys **digital AI agents for healthcare** and **provided language service to over 1 billion Indians through AI**. These examples **reflect** that you have a great sense of **social responsbility**. And I know Nvidia also created a friendly and productive富有成效的 environment for employees and I'm sure I will have a wondeful experience if I could join the Nvidia. 

- 个人（deep impression(childhood): first GPU. senior student: working in Nvidia=>full of talents，progress on the technology attracts me）

  Frankly, Nvidia left a **deep impression** on me when I was a **child**. The **first GPU** in my life is designed by Nvidia(gtx 960). When I was in college, a **senior student** was working in Nvidia. From him, I know more about your company and I got to know this place is full of talents around the world. His progress on the technology also attracts me to join the Nvidia to improve myself.

- These are the reasons why I really want to be part of your company. 

### future plans

How do you see yourself in 5 years?

- I want to divide my future plans to two parts. 

- (improvement of technology, I've leaned...but not enough. work time: main responsibility-> architecture, business. spare time: curious...how cpp works->first year: Compilation Principles, Operating System. second year: standard document)

  (技术)In the first 1-2 years, I want to focus on the **improvement of technology**. Like I mentioned before(Up to now), **I've leaned** about the generic, concurrent and network programming. But I think, it's **not enough** for me. I think, **in my work time**, my **main responsibility** is to clarify the **architecture** and **business** of the project. And **in my spare time**, I'm now really curious about **how the cpp works**, so I will **more deeply** learn the **Compilation Principles** and **Operating System** in the coming year. And in the next year, I want to study the **core features of modern C++** more systematically, like reading **standard document** of C++14 and C++17.

- (solve the problems more efficiently, write high-quality code. join a open source projects of Nvidia->unforgettable experience)

  (业务)After that, I hope I can solve the problems more efficiently and write high-quality code in the future, **based on the knowledge** I learned in the first two years. And I also want to **join a open source projects of Nvidia**, I'm pretty sure it will be a **unforgettable experience** in my life.

### adavantages

What are the three qualities that make you an ideal fit for this position? /How do you believe you would benefit Nvidia? 

I think I have three/several **outstanding qualities**, which can make me benefit Nivdia. 

(基础知识)The first advantage is **solid foundation基础 in C++ area**. I have learned about **c++ basics** all by myself and I **keep learning** even after I graduated from school. Up to now(Like I said before), I've got familiar with **generic, concurrent and network programming**. 

（经验丰富，干了三年c++项目，最自豪的：云会议系统基于我所学的知识。此外，↑40需求在4个月；证明我对新环境的适应能力，因为我能……在短时间内）

(很多经验)In addition, I have a lot of **project experience** in this area and I have been doing c++ projects for about **3 years**. Among all of the projects I've finished, I'm most **proud** of the one where I created a **cloud meeting system** based on the things I have learned and uploaded it to GitHub. 

(适应能力强)**More-over**此外, when I joined my current project team, I finished more than **40 demands** from my supervisor in only **4 months** and I won the Best New Employee award of my company, which **'demonstrate**证明 my **adaptability** to a new environment, since I was able to achieve **all of these** in a very **short time**. 

（交流协作能力，与导师客户常讨论细节，保证同频。让导师知道我的进度。所以我的效率比别人高，获奖）

(交流协作能力)Besides, working at a team requires strong **communicating and co-'or-di-na-ting ability**. When I was working with my mentor, I always 'actively reached out联系 to discuss the 'details with him as well as our clients to ensure we were on the same page. I always kept my mentor 'updated about my working progress. By doing these, I am way more efficient than most of my colleagues. 

### disadavantages

What do you think is the biggest disadvantage of you? What is the biggest challenge in your personal working experience? 

My biggest **disadvantage** is that I always worry I can't finish **all** **of** **my tasks** perfectly when I get **a lot of** them. It brings me a lot of **pressure**. However, I'm trying to **break down** big tasks **into** small ones to make things **easier**. I also try to tell myself it **would be ok** in the end, **as it always was**. 

When I started my **first 'in-tern-ship**, I tended to use only the **technologies** that I was **familiar** with. However, as I worked for longer time, I learned to **jump out** of the **comfort zone** and **em-'b-race**欣然接收 **new things**. I'm still working on it, but I'm sure it **won't be a problem**. 

One last thing is that, like many programmers, I was **not very outgoing** at first. But I realize the **importance of reaching out and communicating** and I spent a lot of **efforts** trying to **open up myself**. 

### questions

Do you have any questions for me?

- I am personally very passionate about learning new technologies. I wonder what important technologies, programming languages do we need in addition to C++ if I join the team? I hope to learn in advance to be better prepared. 
- I am curious to know if we have **professional training** after I join the company? What would it be like? How long will it last? 
- I **wish** to know more about the **developing track** for this position. Could you **offer more information**?

### CV contents

#### 金证科技

##### 工作职责/工作内容

I am currently(now) working at Shenzhen Kingdom science and technology Company. It's a huge company with over **ten thousand** staff. My **main responsibilities** include the **development of new functions**, the **optimization of the algorithm** and the **repair of the bugs**. For example, I added a new feature like **batch operation to freeze or unfreeze holding files**, and optimized a algorithm like **transaction volume warning**. Although I haven't been **staying here** for very long, my excellent adaptability makes me finish the tasks before their due date.

##### 交易量预警算法查询优化

- 项目名称：

  algorithm optimization for transaction交易 volume warning

- 项目需求：

  When a trading day is over, the system will scan the **daily transaction volume** and compare the data with usually the **average transactions** in the 7 days before and generate warnings [you can change the days as you wish]. Originally, this task took **6 minutes for execution** and clients need us to shorten the time. 

- 项目难点：

  The task was very urgent and difficult. There were a ton of complex codes since a lot of tables, functions, variables, macros were invovled. After finishing reading these codes, it was very hard to determine which part cost the most time. Even when we find out the problematic part, we were not sure how to solve it. 

- 解决方式：

  I solve these problems in three steps

  1. First, I got a general understanding of the business. And based on these, I divided the code into two parts: "important" and "unimportant". I gave priority to reading the "important" part and established the connection between the business and the code in the shortest time.
  2. Then, I used RAII to created a log class to record the time spent by each function, and found out the one that cost most time. 
  3. Finally, after reading the function, it was found that the query of the historical table (h_stkprice) cost the most time. Based on experience, I replaced the historical table with the current table(t_stkprice), successfully reducing the running time from 6 minutes to 2 minutes. Because the historical table stores all the data, while the current table only stores the data of the previous 10 days.

##### 证券持仓增加批量操作冻结解冻的功能

- 项目名称：

  batch operation to freeze or unfreeze position-holding files

- 项目需求：

  When the emergency position-holding files are importedinto the disk database, sometimes the records would be mistakenly frozen or unfrozen, which would lead to trade rejections. It is necessary to add the function of batch operation for freezing and unfreezing to support manual freezing or unfreezing of positions.

- 项目介绍（可选）：

  前端可以指定需要操作的记录，并可以选择“冻结”，“解冻”，“冻结至”这三种操作类型的一种并指定需要操作的数量。后端在收到前端消息之后，需要去持仓表kt_combstkbal中查询前端指定的记录，并同时查询内存数据库中记录的持仓的记录，并将内存库中已经冻结的数量根据前端消息进行调整，并重新传回内存库中进行调整。

- 项目难点：

  There were server difficult parts in this project. 

  1. 持仓量的冻结和解冻后的实际可用持仓数量并不是简单地修改数字，因为实际可用持仓量的计算会受到很多因素的影响effect，比如预解锁数量，当日买入数量，当日交易锁定数量等等，所以无法通过直接修改磁盘disk数据库中的冻结数量来满足需求。其次，不是所有的持仓记录都可以进行调整。所以应当先将从实体数据库中查询出来的数据打包传给JSTPX库，查询出可以调整的记录；再该记录进行冻结数量的调整，并重新交给JSTPX库进行实际可用持仓的计算
  2. The second is, when I was checking the holding quantity table, there were many types of holding quantities. I tried to read relevant documents and consulted咨询 my mentor. We decided to build up a new struct to save the T0 type of holding quantities. Through this struct, we were able to filter out the types we needed to send to the JSTP re'po-si-tory.

How are virtual functions different from pure virtual functions? 虚函数和纯虚函数有什么区别？

- 虚函数在基类中有实现，且可以被实例化，纯虚函数在基类中没有实现，不可以被实例化（instantiate）。
- 虚函数用于实现多态，纯虚函数用于实现抽象。
- 虚函数在基类中有实现，而纯虚函数没有实现，必须由派生类实现。纯虚函数使类变为抽象类。
